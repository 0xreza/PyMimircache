  "body": "### Welcome to mimircache, \r\nThe study of cache has a long history, however, there is no single platform for complete analysis of cache traces. That's why we are building mimircache, a python platform for analyzing cache traces. It allows you to visualize your cache traces from different perspectives, and it incorporates time factor when comparing cache replacement algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMimircache is a cache trace analysis platform that supports **comparison of different cache replacement algorithms**, including Least Recent Used(LRU), Least Frequent Used(LFU), Most Recent Used(MRU), First In First Out(FIFO), Clock, Random, Segmented Least Recent Used(SLRU), Optimal, Adaptive Replacement Cache(ARC) and a lot of others. Best of all is that you can easily and quickly **implement your own cache replacement algorithm**.\r\n\r\nFor all cache replacement algorithms, including the ones built-in and the ones you implement yourself, mimircache supports all kinds of comparison, **there is nothing you can't do, there is only things that you can't imagine**. \r\n\r\nTo help you better evaluate different cache replacement algorithms, we also include a variety of visulization tool inside mimircache, for example you can plot hit rate curve(HRC), miss rate curve(MRC), different variants of heatmaps and differential heatmaps. For LRU, it also supports reuse distance calculation, reuse distance distribution plotting and etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Features\r\n------------------ \r\n* Cache replacement algorithms simulation\r\n* A variety of cache replacement algorithms support, including LRU, LFU, MRU, FIFO, Clock, Random, ARC, SLRU, optimal and etc. \r\n* Hit/miss rate curve(HRC/MRC) plotting \r\n* Reuse distance calculation for LRU \r\n* Heatmap plotting for visulizing hit/miss rate change over time, average reuse distance over time, etc.\r\n* Reuse distance distribution plotting. \r\n\r\n\r\nCustomization \r\n------------- \r\nNow you can customize mimircache for your own usage, you can \r\n* provide your own cache reader for reading your special cache trace files. \r\n* write your own profiling method for different cache replacement algorithms. \r\n* write a middleware for sampling your cache traces for analysis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.",
