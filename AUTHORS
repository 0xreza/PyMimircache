The MIMIR Cache project benefits from the efforts of a number of people:

  * Juncheng Yang (Emory University) designed and wrote most of the framework,
  * Ymir Vigfusson (Emory University/Reykjavik University) is the faculty
    sponsor of the project, 
  * Trausti Saemundsson (Reykjavik University) wrote some of the initial cache
    replacement policies, 
  * Shureed Kabir and Arnold Yichu Lin (Emory University) contributed to the
    design and implementation.
