# mimircache

This is the mimircache platform used for analyzing cache trace developed by Emory University, Ymir group 

Currently the platform is still under development. 

Mimircache is a cache trace analysis platform that supports **comparison of different cache replacement algorithms**, including Least Recent Used(LRU), Least Frequent Used(LFU), Most Recent Used(MRU), First In First Out(FIFO), Clock, Random, Segmented Least Recent Used(SLRU), optimal, Adaptive Replacement Cache(ARC) and we are currently adding more cache replacement algorithms. Best of all is that you can easily and quickly **implement your own cache replacement algorithm**.
