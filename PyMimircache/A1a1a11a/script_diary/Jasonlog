ASig2:
    1. add decay_coefficient, because 1116AkamaiSigmoidPrediction shows this is crucial
    2. make x_max no smaller avg rd
    3. set x_max no more than max_rd
    4. set x_max no more than cache_size * 2
    5. check overflow
    6. fitting_period_init 12, fitting_period 6
    7. use all the access dist to fit a curve for general prediction, expected_dist_for_obj_should_be_evicted
    8. don't evict item from ASig unless it is expired
    9. if x_max > expected_dist, set to expected_dist_for_obj_should_be_evicted[1]
    10.
